WEEK 1
This week I created my page and figured out how to make Processing JS work properly in a browser. I learned that in order for it to run, it must be hosted, and as such needs to be a live page for me to observe changes. Once that was done, I then created my canvas and started work. The player character is now controllable, in that they respond to keystrokes and as such move forward and backwards. They also respond to pressing up on the arrow keys, which causes the player character to jump. A basic collider system has also been set in place so that players can jump on top of platforms. Some basic html and css were added. Objects were created for the player character and for platforms, and a simple HUD was added. I fell behind what I wanted to do this week, as the collider took me longer than expected, and the camera control that I had intended to implement did not work. I will hopefully make up for it in the coming weeks. My next focus is finishing the collider, and making the "camera" track the player.

This is the tutorial I referred to occasionally.
